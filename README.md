Vivvo is a global utility for self-sovereign identity--that is, an identity that nobody controls
except its natural owner, that can't be taken away or stripped of its privacy or manipulated
through unreasonable terms of service. Imagine if you could bring your identity with you to
all your digital interactions, instead of creating new logins for every online bank, every mobile
app, every social network, every email client, every government agency, every shopping site...
Imagine if they logged in to you, instead of the other way around... Vivvo uses distributed ledger
(blockchain) technology to achieve this freedom, and it leverages very sophisticated cryptography
to make it all secure and private.
